# Optimal Charging and Routing of Electric Vehicles (EVs)

### Project Overview

This project focuses on optimizing both the routing and charging processes for Electric Vehicles (EVs) to enhance travel efficiency and convenience. By leveraging data on road conditions, battery status, and charging infrastructure, the system provides intelligent routing solutions that balance travel time, charging needs, and cost-efficiency.

### Objective

- Routing Optimization: Identify the most efficient route for EVs by considering key factors such as distance, traffic conditions, and road quality to minimize travel time and energy consumption.
- Charging Optimization: Determine optimal charging stops along the route to minimize charging time, reduce costs, and ensure vehicles maintain sufficient battery levels throughout the journey.

### Key Features

- Real-Time and Historical Traffic Data Integration: Incorporates traffic data to suggest routes that minimize delays and improve overall travel efficiency.
- Battery Level Monitoring and Prediction: Tracks current battery levels and predicts future energy consumption, ensuring that vehicles donâ€™t run out of charge mid-journey.
- Charging Station Optimization: Identifies the best charging stations based on availability, pricing, and proximity to the route, allowing users to balance between time and cost.
- User Preferences: Customizes the route and charging recommendations based on user priorities, such as preferring the fastest route or the most economical charging options.
