# Optimal Charging and Routing of Electric Vehicles (EVs)

### Project Overview

This project focuses on optimizing both the routing and charging processes for Electric Vehicles (EVs) to enhance travel efficiency and convenience. By leveraging data on road conditions, battery status, and charging infrastructure, the system provides intelligent routing solutions that balance travel time, charging needs, and cost-efficiency.

### Objective

- Routing Optimization: Identify the most efficient route for EVs by considering key factors such as distance, traffic conditions, and road quality to minimize travel time and energy consumption.
- Charging Optimization: Determine optimal charging stops along the route to minimize charging time, reduce costs, and ensure vehicles maintain sufficient battery levels throughout the journey.

| **Longitude**       | The longitude coordinate of the EV charging station.                                                                            | Locates the station on a map. Longitude ranges from -180 to 180 degrees.                                                      |
| **Station_Name**    | The name of the EV charging station.                                                                                            | Provides a human-readable identifier for the charging station (e.g., brand names, location names, or specific identifiers).    |
| **ConnectionTypeID**| An identifier for the type of connection used by the charging station.                                                          | Refers to the type of charging connector (e.g., Type 1, Type 2, CCS, CHAdeMO). Requires cross-referencing with an ID table.    |
| **Amps**            | The current capacity of the charging station in amperes (Amps).                                                                 | Indicates the electrical current that the charger can provide. Higher values typically result in faster charging.              |
